Any presentations in this folder are markdown using the [Marpit markdown presentation format](https://marpit.marp.app/) in the [Marp ecosystem of presentation tools](https://marp.app/).

If you're using VS Code, an easy way to see them in presentation form is to install the [Marp extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) for VS Code.
